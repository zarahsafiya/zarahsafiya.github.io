# What is Python?

Python is a general purpose scripting language that has many features and is often considered to be a great beginner coding language for programmers. This is due to Python being an easy and intuitive language, has concise syntax, and has a compact design that contains many useful library functions.

# What is the difference between R and Python?

While both R and Python are powerful programming languages, R is known to be mainly used for statistical analysis while Python is more of a general purpose language. 

# Example of R and Python Together

```{r}
library(reticulate)
hi <- "Hello"
```

```{python}
hi = "world"
print(r.hi,hi)
```

```{r}
cat(c(hi,py$hi))
```

# Example of Python

In the following example, I used Python to create a function which returns a new string like the original user-input str, except that the user-input ch has now been inserted at the i position of the string. If the i index is greater than the length of the string, "Invalid index" is returned.

```{python}
def myInsert( str, i, ch ):
    s = str
    finalCharacter = len(str)
    currentCharacter = 0
    if i > finalCharacter:
        print("Invalid index")
        return None
    else:
        part1 = s[0:i]
        part2 = s[i:]
    return part1 + ch + part2

myInsert("abc", 0, "d")
myInsert("abc", 2, "d")
myInsert("abc", 4, "d")
```
